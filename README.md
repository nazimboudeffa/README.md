# Hi!

<p> First of all before to start socializing, I am not a productive person suffering from health issues and engaged in Dudeism without the side effects of this life style but I choose quality code instead, a code that is readable by everyone and that is structured for a better maintenance, I like to help others learn to code and I don't answer or open issues if I don't get all the workaround instead of that I like to discuss in Slack or Discord </p>

# BOOKS

<p> I try to write some books, I will probably not finish them as usual so I use a writer pseudonyme because I don't want my name to be on a stolen PDF on the Internet</p>
<p> So please respect that and know that the books are Creative Common on my GitHub account</p>
